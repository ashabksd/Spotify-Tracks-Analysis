# 🎧 Spotify Tracks Analysis

Uncovering the patterns behind the music — an exploratory data analysis of 2000+ Spotify tracks to understand what makes a song popular, energetic, and loud.

---

## 📌 Overview

This project dives into a dataset of Spotify tracks to explore:

- 🎵 What characteristics define popular music?
- 🔊 Is loudness linked to energy?
- ⏱️ Are longer songs more popular?
- 📈 Which audio features tend to cluster together?

Using **Python**, **Pandas**, **Seaborn**, and **Matplotlib**, I analyze and visualize key insights from Spotify audio features such as energy, tempo, loudness, and popularity.
